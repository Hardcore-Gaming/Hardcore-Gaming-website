        *HowToPlay*
        The object of baseball is to score more runs than your opponent.
        The idea is to hit the ball thrown at you as far as you can before 
        running around 4 bases to complete a run. Once a player manages to 
        get around the four bases before being tagged out, then another batter steps in.
        To win a game, you must outscore your opposition through the 9 innings played.
        The team with the most points after 9 innings is deemed the winner. In the event of
        a tie, extra innings are played until a winner has been concluded.
        </p>
        *Rules*
        Baseball has two teams of 9 players.
        The fielding team’s positions are made up of a pitcher, catcher, first baseman,
        second baseman, shortstop, third baseman, and three outfielders at left field,
        centre field and right field.
        Games last for 9 innings of which both teams get to bat once. If the game is
        a tie after 9 innings then an extra inning will be added until a winner is found.
        If the team batting second in the bottom of the 9th inning are already ahead in points,
        then they do not need to complete their batting innings.
        Once a batting order is picked, then it cannot be changed throughout the game.
        Substitutes are permitted, however, they must bat in the order of the previous player
        whom they replaced.
        If the batter manages to hit the ball from the pitcher, they must make an effort to at
        least get to first base. They can then run to as many bases as they wish before being tagged out.
        Each base must be touched with some part of the batters body when running past.
        A batter gets up to three strikes before getting out. A strike is deemed when a batter swings
        for a ball and misses it. The batter can leave the ball but, if it’s within a certain area
        (called the 'strike zone'), then a strike will also be given. If four balls miss the strike
        zone and the batter does not swing their bat, they can walk to first base.
        When on base, the batter can run to the next base at any point.
        Players can be dismissed by either a 'strike out' (referring to a batsman missing the ball
        three times), 'force out' (when a player fails to make the base before the defensive player),
        'fly out' (when the ball is hit in the air and caught without it bouncing), and 'tag outs'
        (where a defensive player with the ball tags the batsman with the ball all whilst they are running).

        *HowToPlay*
        The object of basketball is to throw the ball (basketball) into a hoop
        to score points. The game is played out on a rectangular court and depending
        on which section of court you successfully throw a ball into the basket will
        depend on how many points are scored. The ball can be moved around the by
        dribbling or passing the ball. At the end of the game the team with the most
        points is declared the winner.Winning a game of basketball is pretty simple;
        score more points than your opponents in the allotted game time. If the scores
        are tied at the end then an extra quarter will be played until a winner is found.

        *Rules*
        Each team is made up of 12 players with only 5 allowed on the court at any time.
        The positions are broken up into Point Guard, Defensive Guard, Center, Offensive
        forward and Defensive Forward. Each player will then take up a position on the
        court but are allowed to move around as they please.
        Outside the three-point line (3pts)
        —the highest number of points that can be achieved is when a basket
        is scored from outside the three-point line.
        Inside the three-point line (2pts)
        —any basket shot inside the line earns two points.
        Free throw (1pt)
        —a free throw from the free-throw line is worth one point. It is an
        unchallenged shot at the basket, awarded after a foul by the opposition.

        *Fouls*
        Technical foul
        —these are awarded against any player or coach for unsportsmanlike behavior
        such as swearing or arguing with a referee. This leads to at least one free
        throw and possession of the ball. If a player or coach receives two technical
        fouls, he or she is removed from the game.
        Persistent fouling
        —this can lead to a player being removed from the game. If a player commits
        five fouls they must leave the game permanently, but can be substituted.
        Team foul
        —this is called when a team has committed five fouls of any kind in any one period.
        The opposing team is awarded with two free throws.
        Violation
        —a violation of the rules covers such things as an illegal dribble or not releasing
        the ball within the specified time limits. Possession is handed to the opposition.
        Backcourt violation
        —an attacking player with the ball may not cross back over the halfway line once he
        or she has advanced the ball beyond it.

        *Shots*
        Jump shot
        —a shot performed while jumping in the air. The ball is released at
        the highest point off the ground, and is often used when shooting over
        a defender trying to block the ball.
        Lay-up
        —a shot when a player moves to the basket with the ball and rolls it off
        his or her fingertips into the basket.
        Bank shot
        —a shot in which the ball touches the backboard before it goes into the hoop.
        Dunk (or Jam)
        —a player slams the ball into the basket from jumping into mid-air.
        Hook shot
        —a one-handed shot with the shooter facing sideways to the hoop and arcing the
        ball over the defending player to score.
        Free throw
        —a free shot taken from the foul line as the result of a foul.

        Personal foul — this is when illegal body contact occurs between opposing players. Common examples are charging, blocking, holding, illegal guarding, pushing, illegal screening, hand checking, and illegal hand use.
        A personal foul results in either a player taking free throws or a team losing possession of the ball.
        Charging — called by the official when an attacking player moving with the ball runs straight into a defender.
        Blocking — a defensive player may not stand in the way or ‘block’ a dribbling player unless that defender has established a legal guarding stance.
        Holding — this is when personal contact is made with an opponent to slow their movement.
        Illegal guarding — when a defending player bumps into an opponent from behind.
        Pushing — this is exactly as it sounds, and applies even when a player does not have possession of the ball.
        Illegal screening — an attempt to slow down or stop an opponent who does not have control of the ball.
        Hand checking — when a defending player uses their hands to grab or slow an opponent.
        Illegal hand use — when contact is made on an opponent when they are attempting to release the ball.<br></p>

        *Rules*
        The game is won when one of the players first pots all of their assigned
        object balls (solids or stripes) and then legally pots the 8-ball. A legally
        potted 8-ball means that the player first calls which pocket the 8-ball will
        be going in and then successfully sinks the ball in that pocket. If the player
        misses the pocket, it’s the opposing player’s turn to shoot until a foul or miss occurs.
        If, however, the 8-ball goes into any other pocket other than the one called, the
        opposing player wins the game. The opposing player also wins if the cue ball is pocketed
        along with the 8-ball on a called 8-ball shot. Even if the 8-ball goes into the called
        pocket. The cue ball has to stay on the table in order for an 8-ball shot to be legal.

        *HowToPlay*
        The aim of football is to score more goals then your opponent in
        a 90 minute playing time frame. The match is split up into two halves
        of 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes players will take a 15 minute
        rest period called half time. The second 45 minutes will resume and any
        time deemed fit to be added on by the referee (injury time) will be accordingly.
        To win you have to score more goals than that of your opponents. If the
        scores are level after 90 minutes then the game will end as a draw apart
        from in cup games where the game can go to extra time and even a penalty
        shootout to decide the winner. Players must use their feet to kick the ball
        and are prohibited to use their hands apart from goalkeepers who can use any
        part of their body within the 18 yard box (of which more can be found out in the next section).


        *Rules*
        Each team can have a minimum off 11 players (including 1 goalkeeper who is the only
        player allowed to handle the ball within the 18 yard box) and a minimum of 7 players
        are needed to constitute a match.
        The field must be made of either artificial or natural grass. The size of pitches is
        allowed to vary but must be within 100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide. The pitch
        must also be marked with a rectangular shape around the outside showing out of bounds,
        two six yard boxes, two 18 yard boxes and a centre circle. A spot for a penalty placed
        12 yards out of both goals and centre circle must also be visible.
        The ball must have a circumference of 58-61cm and be of a circular shape.
        Each team can name up to 7 substitute players. Substitutions can be made at any time of
        the match with each team being able to make a maximum of 3 substitutions per side. In the
        event of all three substitutes being made and a player having to leave the field for injury
        the team will be forced to play without a replacement for that player.
        Each game must include one referee and two assistant referee’s (linesmen). It’s the job of
        the referee to act as time keeper and make any decisions which may need to be made such as
        fouls, free kicks, throw ins, penalties and added on time at the end of each half. The referee
        may consult the assistant referees at any time in the match regarding a decision. It’s the 
        assistant referee’s job to spot offside’s in the match (see below), throw ins for either team and also
        assist the referee in all decision making processes where appropriate.
        If the game needs to head to extra time as a result of both teams being level in a match then
        30 minutes will be added in the form of two 15 minute halves after the allotted 90 minutes.
        If teams are still level after extra time then a penalty shootout must take place.
        The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal.
        For fouls committed a player could receive either a yellow or red card depending on the severity
        of the foul; this comes down to the referee’s discretion. The yellow is a warning and a red
        card is a dismissal of that player. Two yellow cards will equal one red. Once a player is sent
        off then they cannot be replaced.
        If a ball goes out of play off an opponent in either of the side lines then it is given as a
        throw in. If it goes out of play off an attacking player on the base line then it is a goal
        kick. If it comes off a defending player it is a corner kick.
