        Lore:Wars/Desputes
        The wars have been raging on since the dawn of time before the undead. mostly for land because there were some many settlments of there people and more to come. Humans were the first to come to (world) and start settlements. Its unknown where they came from for the time beening. Second was the Orcs they seem to come out the Undiscoverd lands not know of the humans until the day they got hungry for more meat which made them look for further lands in the (world). That was the first war to happen between the Orcs and the Humans between the hungry orcs and the passion to grow bigger. The War between Humans and orc well forever continue there corral for that the orcs that slaghtered Thousands of men, woman, and childern. Also the fact the the Humans killed there strongest warriors and elders. Then there were the Dwarfs that never seen the light of day been born in a underground stronghold. It seemed like they finaly reach the surface after many years some think there just short humans and dwarfs try and say there better and great than human just because of there size. The battle for the cave systems were between the Dwarfs and Human but the dwarfs have problems with the human since then cause they did not know the humans that attcked the dwarfs were from the newest factions Damnation were the one who attacked them for there treasures knowing that Dwarfs are high vaule of gems and jewels. Then some of the humans from the Sancuary thoght to go to the undiscoverd lands turningout it was the oppisite direction found the Eleves. The Eleves were nice people unless they were blood eleves which were eleves that wanted to bemore powerful than peacful. when the humans ran in the elves they were nutral but the only problem was the people who killed the trees on there land. Which started a small war untill the blood elves start noticing and start kill humans like crazy then they found them. Before there were normal undead there was the necromancer (name) who wanted to take over the whole world with his undead army so all the humans, dwarfs, elves and even the orc rose togther to kill the undead and the wraith of the overpowered Necromancer (name)
        So then on they chose to live in peace but like i said there were races growing bigger and now no one can be friendly when it come to the survival of each others races. So the claiming of land, relics, resource, and power has started.
        Lore:Past Times
        Before all the race were against each other(expt.Undead) before all came togther to stop the Oldest Strongest Necromancer (NoName) from claiming the (world) for himself and nothing but Horror and Despare. Sence the Necromancers been gone they return to there main goals which is to prove who is worthy to be named king of the (world).
